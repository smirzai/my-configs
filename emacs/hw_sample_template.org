   - Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
   - For the sake of contradiction assume that $(A-B) \cap (B-A)$ is not empty.
   - Therefore there must be an element $x$ where $x \in (A-B)$ and $x \in (B-A)$.
   - As a result, $x \in A \land \notin B$ and $x \in A \land \notin B$ by the definition of set subtraction.
   - We have a contradiction, and must therefore conclude that (A-B) \cap (B-A) = \emptyset .
